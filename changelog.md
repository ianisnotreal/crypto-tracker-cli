### üì¶ Release Automation

Each new version is published by:
1. Bumping the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Committing with a message like  
   `release: bump version to 0.3.0`
3. Tagging the release:  
   ```bash
   git tag v0.3.0
   git push && git push --tags
GitHub Actions (release.yml) builds and publishes to PyPI automatically.
